College project that I decided to develope in Node.js, Express.js using EJS templating and using MySql database.

I also decided to use npm package called passport.js for authenticating and login user, I had few problems here with authenticating and loging
different type of users, but I managed to fix that. 

There are 3 user types, admin, teacher and student.
Student can register and enrole in different type of classes, while teacher is registerd by administrator of the site and he can
can only see classes he's teaching and student in his classes.

This is just begining, few days of coding, nothing big.

Things to be done:
- list of students that are enroled in class when teacher selects that class
- admin can delete teacher and class
- fix student view

One thing to notice here, Croatian language is used in application.

Live long and prosper  \V/_
